# Agent Engineering Playbook

Pragmatic guidance for building AI-assisted software that can survive enterprise expectations: security reviews, auditability, reliability, change control, and production operations.

## What This Repository Is

This repository is a working playbook for teams building production systems with human engineers and AI agents. It does not assume that speed alone is success. It treats delivery, safety, operability, and maintainability as first-class concerns.

The material is organized into twelve playbooks:

0. [Adoption Paths](playbooks/00-adoption-paths.md)
1. [Project Setup](playbooks/01-project-setup.md)
2. [Architecture](playbooks/02-architecture.md)
3. [Team Roles](playbooks/03-team-roles.md)
4. [Design Principles](playbooks/04-design-principles.md)
5. [Development Workflow](playbooks/05-development-workflow.md)
6. [Testing Strategy](playbooks/06-testing-strategy.md)
7. [Quality Assurance](playbooks/07-quality-assurance.md)
8. [Documentation](playbooks/08-documentation.md)
9. [Production Readiness](playbooks/09-production.md)
10. [Security and Governance](playbooks/10-security-and-governance.md)
11. [Change Management and Incidents](playbooks/11-change-management-and-incidents.md)

## What Changed In This Hardening Pass

The original material had strong practical instincts, but several sections were still too opinionated for enterprise use:

- Roles were too rigid and depended too much on a single lead.
- Review and release guidance was sometimes optimized for local velocity over controlled change.
- Security, compliance, incident handling, disaster recovery, and supply-chain concerns were underrepresented.
- Some recommendations were tool-specific, fragile, or unsafe as general guidance.
- A few repository references pointed to files that did not exist.

This revision shifts the playbook toward:

- risk-based delivery instead of personality-based process
- explicit governance and traceability
- secure-by-default engineering practices
- operational readiness before production
- short feedback loops without lowering release discipline

It now also distinguishes between:

- a `core path` for every serious product team
- an `enterprise path` for products with higher customer, compliance, security, or operating complexity

## How To Use It

For a new initiative:

1. Start with [Adoption Paths](playbooks/00-adoption-paths.md).
2. Run the [Phase Assessment Checklist](checklists/phase-assessment.md).
3. Start with [Project Start Checklist](checklists/project-start.md).
4. Write a project charter, architecture context, and initial ADRs.
5. Choose the smallest architecture and delivery model that satisfies current risk.
6. Define security ownership, change controls, and incident expectations.
7. Set release gates before feature work begins.

For an existing product:

1. Start with [Adoption Paths](playbooks/00-adoption-paths.md).
2. Run the [Phase Assessment Checklist](checklists/phase-assessment.md).
3. Run the [Pre-Production Checklist](checklists/pre-production.md).
4. Run the [Security Review Checklist](checklists/security-review.md) when sensitive paths or enterprise obligations apply.
5. Compare current process against [Development Workflow](playbooks/05-development-workflow.md), [Quality Assurance](playbooks/07-quality-assurance.md), and [Security and Governance](playbooks/10-security-and-governance.md).
6. Close missing controls in testing, observability, documentation, rollout strategy, access governance, and incident readiness.

## Core Principles

- Start with clear outcomes, constraints, and operating assumptions.
- Prefer simple architectures until complexity is justified by scale or risk.
- Keep changes small, testable, and reversible.
- Require evidence for shipping: tests, review, observability, and rollback.
- Treat documentation, runbooks, and decision records as part of the product.
- Use AI agents as force multipliers, not as substitutes for ownership and controls.
- Make access, change approval, and incident response explicit before scale forces them.

### Machine-Readable Model
- [models/adoption-model.json](models/adoption-model.json)

## Intended Audience

- Engineering leads establishing delivery standards
- Staff and senior engineers designing architecture and release controls
- Product teams working with AI agents in the development loop
- Founders and CTOs moving from prototype behavior to production discipline
- AI agents that need to adapt process rigor to project phase instead of applying every control immediately

## Adoption Model

Use the repository in two layers:

- `Core path`: the default path for any project expected to reach production quality.
- `Enterprise path`: additional controls that become necessary when customer expectations, regulatory demands, security exposure, or organizational complexity increase.

The decision logic lives in [playbooks/00-adoption-paths.md](playbooks/00-adoption-paths.md).
Agents that need a structured version can use [models/adoption-model.json](models/adoption-model.json).

## Scope And Non-Goals

This repository is intentionally vendor-neutral. It may mention specific tools, but it does not assume a single stack, cloud, proxy, framework, or AI workflow.

It is not:

- a certification framework
- a substitute for legal, privacy, or security specialists
- a substitute for formal compliance programs where they are required
- a promise that every team needs heavyweight process from day one

The goal is proportional rigor: enough control for the risk profile you actually have.

## Contributing

Use [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Proposed changes should explain:

- what weakness in the current guidance is being addressed
- what operational or engineering problem the revision prevents
- what tradeoff the new guidance introduces
